## ***Feeling the Past***: How a interactive text-based educational game could influence historical source selection.

### Introduction

This reflection piece discusses the project *Feeling the Past*, which I created during the spring semester of 2020. The project was part of the module *History in a Digitized World* (DigiZeit) by Martin Dusinberre and Daniel McDonald, tutored by Leyla Feiner. DigiZeit is an exclusive module for students of the Master degree *History of the Contemporary World / Zeitgeschichte* at the University of Zürich. 

It is assumed that the reader has played *Feeling the Past* recently. This can be done on the *Lives in Transit* website here: https://livesintransit.org/login. In the paper—after a brief description of the thought process behind the project—selected challenges are reflected upon and contextualized using contemporary literature to gain new insights for writing history in a digitized age.

### Why is there only a small number of objects in historical source selection?

My initial idea for a project—even before thinking about creating a game—was asking the question of how to introduce more objects into the source selection of historians. I started thinking about this issue in Summer 2019 during an internship at the *Historisches und Völkerkundemuseum St.Gallen* (HVM), where I encountered a large number of fascinating objects and histories, but a significant lack of academic writing thereof. I furthermore observed that the teaching at the University of Zürich focuses strongly on textual sources, which for example is reflected in the *Grundlagenpapier* (Universität Zürich, Historisches Seminar, 2013). The *Grundlagenpapier* aims to serve as the methodological orienting point for young historians studying in Zürich. Yet, in chapter 6 titled "Quellenkritik und Quelleninterpretation" the focus almost exclusively lies on text as source (p. 38ff). Similarily in chapter 7, "Einführung in die Quellenkritik / Quellenanalyse"—even though there is a specific section for "Bilder / Artefakte"—most of the content of the section relates to using images as sources and only very little instructs the reader how to work with objects (p. 42f). Objects often tell different stories or stories closer to the people of the past. There is an important part of history lost when disregarding them as historical sources and a lot of work can be enriched and supplemented considering them closely.

I observed two key reasons for the current situation: accessibility, and the lack of awareness. In comparison to most textual sources, objects are more difficult to represent digitally, almost impossible to replicate, and in general more challenging to gain historical insights from. Text-based sources are more convenient and will therefore be used more frequently. As already illustrated, working with objects is only marginally taught in university and up until recently historians have perceived close work with objects part of other disciplines rather than their own toolkit (Findlen, 2020, p. 271). Thus reaching out to collections or museums and using their objects as sources is only rarely considered by students, who later become researchers; a disconnect quite foreign to the 19th century origins of the field (miller!, history and its objects). The goal of *Feeling the Past* now is to illustrate the possible benefits of working with objects as sources to motivate historians to consider a wider range of sources in their future work.

### Selected Challenges and Insights

#### Collaborative Working using Git

Presenting your work in progress to peers and receiving feedback are essential steps in an historian's work. Current technologies, namely Git, used for version control in software development offer new ways of collaborative working. In the case of *Feeling the Past*, I greatly benefited from using GitLab to communicate with the other students of DigiZeit. This especially showed during the game's beta which was conducted during May, in which the other DigiZeit member were able to give feedback using the "Issues" function. In the later stages of development it was also really useful to have collaborators like Daniel McDonald push changes to the game repository, for example in case of coding mistakes, which I then could either accept or discard. 

While in this case Git was used primarily for software development aspects, the same functionalties can definitely be applied to conventional historical research. Git offers both a well structured discussion platform and version control, which supports clear hierarchies—essentials for productive collaboration. (Some secondary literature about collaborative working in History, maybe Lynn Hunt)

#### Working with ***Lives in Transit***

Working with an existing project had both advantages and disadvantages. For one, creating something as labourious as a computer game—something I definitely would not have been able to complete from scratch in roughly three months—was made possible by utilizing an existing framework. In my case, this did not cause any conflicts between what I wanted to do and what was possible, but it surely influenced how I decided to design my storyline. The tasks are based on the exercises I encountered in the *Lives in Transit* demo and what I remembered of the playtest of *Plantation Lives*. If I had wanted for the player to be able to virtually pick up an object in a 3D environment during an exercise and freely rotate it, this would not have been possible as **Marugoto** does not support 3D modules.

Also, working with project specific software meant that if I encountered an issue or did not understand something, I could not simply use Google to find a solution. While I was learning how to use **Marugoto**, the documentation was still a work-in-progress. Therefore, I either had to solve the issue by trial and error or consult someone more familiar with the project. Collaborative working once again was a key aspect and a key skill necessary to successfully complete *Feeling the Past*. An unfinished project also meant occasionally dealing with newly occurring problems. In the case of *Lives in Transit* these were the dysfunctional importer and the bug during May. As a writer in the project I contributed to the solutions by reporting unexpected behaviour.  

Projecting these insights on historical research, a number of similar observations can be made. With more collaborative research in the humanities being done, historians will need to learn how to act in and interact with a larger framework—both for the success of their own and the overarching project. Collaboration and communication are already key components of 21st century competencies in STEM fields(Jang, 2016). Collaborative historical research will lead to limitations and opportunities (LITERATURE). While for example having a certain thematic restriction for the research topic, a larger project may facilitate access to a greater number of archives and sources an individual might not be able to access—be it because of time or legal reasons.

#### Conveying the right insights

Examining the pedagogical attempts *Feeling the Past* is making, the second task of the game is most interesting to talk about. In this exercise the player is confronted with the question what information a conventional data-set can and cannot give. The in-game choice made by the player has no impact on the later stages of the game. The task represents the real-life problem of not knowing definitely if the correct choice was made. There often is no way to unambiguously know if a specific object is connected to a specific data-set.

Data-bases are a historian's window into an archive or a collection. Their structure influences the way we select sources and shape our research. Naturally, they (primarily internal data-bases) tend to focus on their job as archival tools rather than a historian's research help (LITERATURE). 

In the submitted version for DigiZeit, in which the correct answer is never revealed, the message of the task may be too subtle for the player to notice. The exercise therefore only works as a way of reversing the first one and having the player think based on a data-set. In the published version the collection manager, Frederic, later tells the player that he found the inventory number on a mortar and identified the right one. Here the intended message of sometimes not knowing for sure which object belongs to which data-set is also not conveyed.

*Changing nature of data-sets? Holes in narrative structures?*

#### Normativity of Museums / Data-sets

The centerpiece of *Feeling the Past* is the third task of the game: The player has the choice between three different objects with different kinds of information. With every choice the player is simply asked to think freely think about the object and take notes. The first object, an apothecary scale, is displayed with both a complete data-set and multiple pictures. This simulates being in a collection and standing right in front of the desired object, the optimal case. The second choice is missing the object, a ventilator. The player only receives a data-set and a deficient picture. This exercise is once again modeled after a real life problem, having to deal with incomplete or bad information. The last object is a straitjacket. The data-set is a reconceptualized version of the conventional data-set seen in the upper two choices. It is a text written by myself in the style of Neil MacGregor's *A History of the World in 100 Objects*, based both on the original data-set of the HVM and my personal impressions of the object. This was an attempt to rethink how information is stored in collections, and how it might be possible to facilitate the work of historians interested in objects by changing how and which information is collected.

#### The Limits and Possibilities of Marugoto

In the following section I will review the most important tools I used while creating *Feeling the Past*. This discussion will not go into too much depth, as I simply do not have the expertise to critique these tools other than how well they achieved what I intended to use them for in my project.

**Marugoto** proved to be a good authoring tool for creating a piece of interactive fiction with an educational intent. Similar to **uAdventure** by Manuel et al., it allowed someone without a lot of technical experience to create a fully functional game by mainly using examples and a manual to learn without a great amount of specific training (Pérez-Colado et al., 2019). At the same time, the authors also found that in teaching a workshop-based approach to game-making allowed them to explore more advanced goals in smaller periods compared to a self-taught approach while possibly leading to "false successes" (p. 40). During the last session of DigiZeit I was asked if I had preferred something more complex like a 3D based engine. In my opinion this would have caused the game to be more focused on the experience of *being* in the museum instead of the exercises and what can be learned by them. Additionally the workload of creating a 3D game—even with a existing engine and presets—would have meant less freedom and less time to conceptually work on the game. Using a text-based engine and static pages allows the player to focus on the tasks, which, for me, were the most important part. My familiarity with *Lives in Transit* and its limits and possibilities before beginning the project helped me to quickly plan the contents of the game. There is a fair bit of functionality of **Marugoto** I did not explore in my game. The main reason for this is the lack of time and partially a lack of awareness. The learning curve of **Marugoto** was steep, having to understand both how the folder hierarchy relates to the different pages displayed and what each variable controls. Once understood though, the work becomes fluent, as the knowledge of one functionality facilitates the learning of the next. I think a person without much technical experience will be able to pick it up in a few days, even more so now that there exists a tutorial and a documentation.

**Sublime Text 3** and the version control software **Sublime Merge** proved to be good choices. The most useful feature of **Sublime Text 3** was the syntax highlighting. It facilitated the understanding of exisiting and new code as well as occasional mistakes. Upon recommendation of Daniel McDonald I installed packages, add-ons for **Sublime Text 3**, which further streamlined the workprocess, such as a package to automatically check if there is a newline at the end of code and add one, if it is absent. The most useful feature of **Sublime Merge** was displaying the changes to files in red and green, so proofreading changes before pushing was quick and easy. For a solo project like mine, having the extensive graphical representation of branches and forks of **Sublime Merge** was not too important, but I imagine for a bigger project it would prove useful.

The two content hosts used, **GitHub** and **GitLab**, were necessities for connecting the repository of *Feeling the Past* with the test system and communicating with the other students of DigiZeit. The Git functionality made it easy for other people to take a look at my project in an unfinished state and make suggestions. In my opinion it could also be used for co-writing historical papers and other tasks unrelated to software development. I feel like the most important feature is having a master file, which all involved people can contribute to in form of pull requests, but at the same time allowing a clear hierarchy of who accepts and rejects these requests and who does not. This functionality could improve many existing workflows, which still rely on editing one file on a central server. One key issue here is that there can only one person who edits the file at the time which leads to people making copies therefore having multiple different versions of the same file floating around. This problem can be solved with by Git.

#### Other possibilities to solve fundamental observation

Museums, Databases, other projects?

#### Practical Tasks and Unmet Goals

The discussion of the tasks will be based on the feedback of the play-test during May and my own impressions of how the tasks turned out in the finished product.

The first task is, in my eyes, a good introduction into both how the following exercises are designed and how a historian can get information from an object. In the closed beta the task was not mentioned, which I interpret as a good sign. The task achieves what I created it for. 

The third exercise was in my opinion successful at exposing players to different kinds of information and confronting them with real situations they might encounter if they choose work with objects. The apothecary scale, the most complete set of information, simulates as close as possible, using **Marugoto**, physically standing in front of an object and using it as a source. I feel like the scale is an interesting object to examine, as it allows a number of different historical perspectives. It is a visually appealing object thus having multiple pictures of it has a greater effect than the ventilator or the straitjacket. The limitations for the players working with the ventilator already showed up in the play-test, in which the question came up, what to do with it and how to work around the object's lack of physical appearance besides a rather bad picture. In that sense the exercise was successful in confronting the players with the correct issue while possibly overwhelming them. The reconceptualized data-set felt like a nice idea, but if I had more time I would have liked to develop it further. I think an clear argument can be made for how it might be beneficial for historians to store information in data-bases differently. But this aspect was not of high priority for the DigiZeit version of *Feeling the Past*, and the time was simply limited.

The last task ties the beginning and the end together nicely. Some of the play-testers felt like the game ended rather abruptly and would have liked a final reflection of the main character. In achieving the learning effect I aimed for, this ending is more appropriate, as the players can decide for themselves how they want to think about their first day in the museum and what insights they have gained. A pre-made reflection would have enforced a kind of authoritative teaching on what the players are supposed to take home from the game instead of having them make a conclusion themselves. 

#### Marugoto as a teaching device for contemporary history

The intended target group of *Feeling the Past* are university students doing their bachelor's or master's degree. I wanted to make an impact on the source selection in academic history, so apprentice scholars are an appropriate target group. Because I am only familiar with studying history on a bachelor's and master's level and wanted game to be relatable, I chose a Master student as the playable character instead for example a PhD student like in *Plantation Lives*. The story therefore assumes that the player has at least some knowledge of source analysis. During the feedback discussion in the last session of DigiZeit, the question was raised whether the game would also be applicable for other people, for example high school students or museum visitors. The game itself of course is playable by people without prior knowledge of historical work and source selection, but the effect would not be the same. For museum visitors the game could present an insight behind the scenes of a museum. For high school student the game could also show what it feels like doing an internship at a museum or studying history. But for both groups the intended goal would not be met. 

Martin Dusinberre mentioned that the demand of finding new ways to teach history exists among high school teachers. **Marugoto** could definitely be a way of conveying historical ideas on high school level. But I feel like the story has to be specifically written for the target group to be most effective. If I were to rewrite *Feeling the Past* for high school students, I would change the main character to someone who has just finished their school years and is interested in history. Erick Lauber raises the question of character in video games (Lauber, 2005). The ideal case for a game-designer in his opinion would be to have a character just like the user. This would increase "identifiability and, presumably, learning" (p. 53). I agree with this statement. The tasks in a rewrite would be more basic at the beginning, but could definitely become more complex as the game goes on. This way the player could become familiar with the work inside a museum and of a historian.

Another suggestion was playing the game from inside the museum. For *Feeling the Past* in the present state the added benefit would not be significant. But as a general idea, games offer a real addition to the classic museum experience. It has been shown that a collaborative learning strategy between schools and museums can reinforce students' learning experience (Griffin, 2004). Bossavit et al. argue that applying informal educational tools like games within a formal learning context can enhance museum experiences and link them to classrooms (Bossavit et al., 2018). A rewrite of *Feeling the Past* could involve having the player physically finding the object in the collection and inspect it in person. This would strengthen the main argument that there is something to gain from using objects as historical sources. The play-through, a mix of virtual and real experiences, would have to be supervised if the players are physically interacting with real objects, but it would improve both the experience of being in the museum and learning about objects as historical sources. Still, it is important for the game to be created with the museum context in mind. Jenner and de Araújo have created a learning game for the German Maritime Museum centered around a conserved cog (Jenner & de Araújo, 2009). They noted based on behavioural research of museum visitors that for a game to be played inside the museum it has to capture the potential player's attention within 1-2 minutes, otherwise they pass onto the next module. Furthermore, long instructions should be avoided and the overall playtime should not be over 10 to 15 minutes.

### Conclusion

*Feeling the Past* had (and still has) the ambitious goal to change how historians select the sources they use in their work. It is too early to make any assessment of success or failure. However, I feel like an educational game like *Feeling the Past* can be a way to achieve change and the literature seems to support this thesis. I consider the open approach of *Feeling the Past*—giving the player freedom and allowing them to interpret the exercises based on their own interests—one of the best ways to show people what can be gained from historical sources. The future for educational games seems bright as more funding is allocated for it and multiple fields are interested in pursuing their possibilites for the humanities. A lot of work is being done on how to achieve desired pedagogical goals trough games. The opportunities are countless and the creative freedom of game-making specifically allows for various new approaches in writing and teaching history.
