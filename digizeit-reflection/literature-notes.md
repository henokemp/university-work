### Jan & Gaydos: What Is Game-Based Learning? Past, Present, and Future, 2016

Goal: clarify and conceptualize game-based learning (GBL) to pinpoint directions for practices and research.

Authors Argument: GBL should be conceptualized toward the transformation of a textbook-learning culture, paradigm shift, reorientation

Article: four types of games for learning and three GBL models

**Article more focused on lower level education!**

#### Notes

James Paul Gee, *What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, 2003*

Question of Head of Department of School which uses a lot of games: What subject is the game about? What activities have you considered to go with the game? How do you evaluate students' learning? 

"Games as an interactive medium afford the design of two essential learning components for higher-order thinking and social skills - authentic problem-solving contexts and guided participation (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989)."

Four reasons for Games been promoted to help people learn: **motivation, drill and practice, content mastery, and 21st century competencies** => *Feeling the Past* most likely part of motivation games!

**Motivation Games**: Games that engage students in the behaviour of learning desirable content or information. Fun element (humour?), digital natives engage more easily with interactive games, equivocal if students are really learning,

**Drill and Practice Games**: acquisition and familiarization of ready-made content, not design for learning new concepts and have little to do with higher-order thinking skills

**Content Mastery Games**: facilitate the mastery of information, facts, concepts, or canonical knowledge

**21st Century Competency Games**: foster higher-order thinking and social skills, such as problem-solving inquiry, argumentation, systems thinking, and collaboration

Three conceptualizations of GBL (*Feeling the Past* most likely fits the first model): 

**GBL as a Learning Approach Driven by Game Technologies**: "This view often assumes that learning occurs predominantly *as the result of* and *within* the game play. Therefore, the ideal learning experience takes place when players can play a game at their own pace and learning style." S. 8, emphasis in original, self directed play, *Feeling the Past* only partially, but giving a the possibility to play at own pace and interpretation for their own interests

**GBL as a Learning Approach Driven by Both Game Technologies and Corresponding Pedagogies**: learning not only inside the game but also with corresponding guidance from teachers, interaction with peers, and other sources, ideal for schools

**GBL as a Pedagogical Approach Informed by Game Design Concepts**: Employs game mechanics and game design thinking to design learning environments, turning the learning setting into a game. Drawing form cognitive science and sociocultural learning theories, good learning design principles

**Textbook-Learning Culture (maybe not that applicable to University)**

Teaching has been design to maximize efficiency of basic content mastery, a much needed 20th century literacy for an industrial society

=> 21st century transformation of learning and skill culture, new emphasis on ability to construct new knowledge, solve problems, collaborate with others, organize activities, and manage communities (Jan & Tan 2013)

Designing 21st CC Games (not really *Feeling the Past* as it's very specific)

### Li & Tsai: Game-Based Learning in Science Education: A Review of Relevant Research, 2013

Review of empirical research articles regarding game-based science learning, 31 articles, qualitative content analysis, development of models, results indicate that cognitivism and constructivism were the major theoretical foundations employed by the GBSL researchers with socio-cultural perspective and enactivism being upcoming models

Vogel et al (2006): Meta-analysis, students who used computer games or interactive simulations (*Feeling the Past*) showed better results in cognitive gains and attitudes toward learning than those who experienced traditional instruction! => Goal of avoiding the authoritative voice makes sense, better learning effect

This article 4 questions: 

1. What are the research purposes and designs of the GBSL studies?
2. How are the digital games designed and implemented to promote science learning?
3. What are the theoretical foundations of the GBSL studies?
4. What are the foci of the GBSL studies in terms of learning?

The 31 articles were focussing on science topics, so no history (see Methodology)

### Bossavit et al.: Educational Games to Enhance Museum Visits for Schools, 2018

"Therefore this paper provides a guideline to design educational games in collaboration with a museum, shows that mini educational games help students in learning artistic concepts and that motion-based touchless interfaces are not really adapted for classroom use."

Clear learning strategy between schools and museums reinforce students' learning experience (Griffin, 2004).

**Check these out:**

Amongst these studies, some educational games focused on engaging the visitors to interact with the museum artefacts either through quiz games (Belloti et al., 2012; Lien, 2015) or treasure hunting games (Rehm & Jensen, 2015; Yiannoutsou et al., 2014).

The other approach found in the literature is to use storylines
via adventure games to teach either art history with the different genres, eras and techniques (Froschauer et al., 2010) or the use of antique objects (Jenner, Moura, & Araujo, 2009).
