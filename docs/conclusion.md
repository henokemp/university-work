## Conclusion

*Feeling the Past* wants to make a contribution to how historians select their sources. An educational game like *Feeling the Past* can be a way to achieve change and the literature seems to support this thesis. I consider the open approach of *Feeling the Past*—giving the player freedom and allowing them to interpret the exercises based on their own interests—one of the best ways to show people what can be gained from historical sources. The future of educational games is still being debated, funding is allocated and multiple fields are interested in pursuing their possibilites for the humanities while staying critical. The opportunities are countless and the creative freedom of game-making and the technology behind it specifically allows for various new approaches in writing and teaching history. Other solutions to the issues I mentioned live in the realm of databases, collection management, and online accessability. Here as well, funding is being put into restructuring and rethinking collections and how historians can access them. I still feel like the distance between museums, collections, and historians can be decreased and collaboration increased—games could be a way to to this—, but things seem to be moving in the right direction.
