### Collaboration Using Git

Presenting your work in progress to peers and receiving feedback are essential steps in an historian's work. Current technologies offer new ways of collaborative working. In the case of *Feeling the Past*, I greatly benefited from using GitLab to communicate with the other students of DigiZeit. This especially showed during the game's beta which was conducted during May, in which the other DigiZeit members were able to give feedback using the *Issues* function. In the later stages of development it was also really useful to have collaborators like Daniel McDonald push changes directly to the game repository, for example in case of coding mistakes, which I then could easily either accept or discard with a single click. 

While in this project Git was used primarily for software development and communicational aspects, the same functionalities can definitely be applied to conventional historical work, for example hosting a digital archive like Maryam Joseph and Manuel Kissoczy, fellow participants of DigiZeit. Git offers both a well structured discussion platform and file version control, in which the rights and duties of each member can be clearly definedâ€”essentials for productive collaboration. Every change is tracked so at any point in time it is transparent who is the author of which work. This could solve some of the issues Rachel Mann raises, like that it is often unclear who can be credited with doing which work when the only product of a collaboration in the humanities is a conventionally credited publication (Mann, 2019). By being able to trace back the contributions of each project member starting from day one, it is visible who made additions to the technical, interpretative, or administrative aspects of the project.
