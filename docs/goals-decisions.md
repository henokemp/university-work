### Unmet Goals and Practical Decisions

### Unmet Goals and Practical Decisions

By choosing the open approach mentioned in the previous paragraph some insights, which I intended to convey, were not successfully communicated. This conclusion is based on the feedback during the beta. One such example is the idea behind the second task of the game, where the player has to choose which object corresponds to a data-set. The choice of the player does not affect the later stages of the game and at no point is there feedback regarding if the choice was correct or false. The aim here was to show the volatility of the work in a collection, that even the people working and creating the databases are sometimes not certain what they are looking at, as well as that the databases historians are working with will not be perfect. Based on the feedback during May, these insights were not communicated successfully. A different approach was chosen in the *Lives in Transit* version. Here later in the game the collection manager mentions that he found an inventory number on one of the objects and was able to connect it to the data-set. The player now has some feedback regarding their choice but is not confronted with the uncertainty of the work in a collection. I am not sure how I can communicate this without losing the open interpretative approach.

Another criticism voiced after publishing *Feeling the Past* was that the people in the museum do not feel like characters but more like narrative devices. While this is subjective, I agree with this opinion. It would be easy to say that this is due to the limited length and short development time of the game, but the heart of the reason lies in my focus on the tasks. The tasks, which I would describe as most important part of the game, received the most of my attention which therefore lead to less development in the character department. For the purpose of the game this is completely fine and justified. For achieving the pedagogical goal of *Feeling the Past*, showing the player what can be gained by using objects as sources, the tasks are more important than the characters. This is different for *Plantation Lives*, where the focus lies much more on the experience of doing research and the connections and relationships formed by that. Here the characters play a different role, which necessitates approaching their writing differently.

While I already disregarded creating a 3D *game*, reflecting on the whole project and what for example the Smithsonian Collections offer, I probably could have created a better experience—in the sense of closer to the actual work with objects—and by that an increased learning effect by using the 3D resources available on the internet. The 3D collection of the Smithsonian is large enough to cover a wide range of subjects and the presentation of the objects from a visual standpoint comes really close to the real experience. This, of course, would have meant writing the story completely different and moving away from my personal experience in the museum in favour of digitally presenting objects closer to reality. The result would have been a different game with a different emphasis, but maybe better apt to communicate the key insights I wanted to convey.
