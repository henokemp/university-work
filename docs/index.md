## ***Feeling the Past***: How an Interactive Text-Based Educational Game Could Influence the Source Selection of Historians.

> This webpage reflects on the game project *Feeling the Past*, which I created for the master's course *History in a Digitized World*. After a brief introduction, discussing the motivation behind the project, I elaborate on selected challenges and essential insights encountered during the production process. This includes collaborative work, *Marugoto*, the main tool used for writing the game, digital databases in relation to objects, and more. The main goal of the project was to illustrate the benefits of using objects as historical sources and thereby having an impact on the source selection of historians. The discussed literature supports the pedagogical approaches chosen for *Feeling the Past* and implies that it can have an impact. It is too early to make a definitive claim, but the project and the literature analysis have shown that using an educational game can be a way to produce new insights.
